# Prairie iGEM's Impact

Last year, the Prairie IGEM team was formed and entered the competition for the first time. We designed a biosensor that could sense zebra mussels and release toxins with a goal to ultimately eradicate zebra mussels in Lake Winnipeg and Manitoba freshwater bodies and minimize harm to the environment and economy. In the early stages, the team earned a prestigious $2,500 impact grant. Presenting the project at the iGEM Grand Jamboree in Paris we earned a silver medal.
