# What is iGEM?

The International Genetically Engineered Machine, known as iGEM, is a two-decade-old competition brought to light with the purpose of challenging young minds to push their limits to further the advancement of synthetic biology, by using it to solve everyday problems in their communities. Now the largest competition of its kind, it was initially set up for five teams hosted at MIT back in 2004. It has since grown into a competition that brought together over 350 teams worldwide last year.

The organization champions entrepreneurship among young adults, providing ample opportunities for determined individuals to go on to develop their projects into successful businesses. Previous iGEM teams have gone on to found companies such as Benchling, Gingko, Opentrons, Hyasynth Bio, and FredSense.

iGEM teams are given four months to take their idea from design to proof-of-concept and to present their work at the annual Grand Jamboree, hosted in Paris this coming November. There are many aspects to the project outside the given biological concept and work in wet labs, such as setting up a website as well as fundraising and outreach initiatives.
