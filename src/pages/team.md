We are an interdisciplinary group of students at the University of Manitoba. Our members come from departments like Biology, Chemistry, Sociology, Computer Science, and Statistics. We are divided into four subgroups: Dry Lab (computational modelling & website development), Wet Lab (experimental work), Industry (fundraising & outreach), and Human Practices (community engagement).
