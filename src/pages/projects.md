### 2023 – PLAnet Zero

Our 2023 project is PLAnet Zero. We are targeting plastic pollution in Manitoba by optimizing enzymes that degrade PLA plastic.

PLA is used worldwide as an eco-friendly alternative to petroleum-based plastics. With the recent single-use plastic ban in Canada, there has been a major switch from PET-based plastics to "biodegradable" PLA. However, PLA requires high temperatures to degrade, so it still contributes to environmental pollution.

PLAnet Zero employs a genetically modified organism that will surface-display PLA-degrading enzymes that have been engineered to function at the optimal temperatures to break down PLA within existing waste management systems in Canada.

PLAnet Zero is overseen by Dr. Nediljko Budisa (Professor, Department of Biochemistry; Canada Research Chair in Synthetic Biology), Dr. David Levin (Professor, Biosystems Engineering), and Dr. Lori Wilkinson (Professor, Department of Sociology; Canadian Research Chair in Migration Futures).

### 2022 – Zebra Zap

Prairie iGEM's 2022 project is the design of a smart bio-based device to control the spread of zebra mussels. Zebra mussels are an invasive species in lakes across Manitoba that harm local biodiversity and cause damage to infrastructure.

Current methods of controlling zebra mussels are focused on stopping their continued spread, but removing zebra mussels currently requires dumping molluscicides into the lake, which is expensive and ecologically damaging.

Our device consists of a sensor that responds to the stomach conditions of a zebra mussel and produces a toxin that targets the mussel without harming surrounding life. Our device is designed for use in Manitoba's wastewater treatment systems.

Zebra Zap is overseen by Dr. Hans-Joachim Wieden (Professor, Department of Microbiology; Associate Vice-President, Partnerships, Knowledge, Mobilization & Innovation) and Dr. Nediljko Budisa (Professor, Department of Biochemistry; Canada Research Chair in Synthetic Biology).

This project was awarded a Silver Medal at the 2022 iGEM Grand Jamboree in Paris.
